Observations:,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. To make the numbers align, both makeup and diversion can be adjusted. A higher proportion of non-recyclable means less recyclables generated, and higher recyclables diversion rates. 
2. Non-recyclable waste appears higher than expected, compared with the earlier waste audits. This may be from faculties and include furniture, etc. However the actual percentage is unknown. 
3. Some recent audits are from sort it out stations which does not reflect everything from a building. ",,,,,,,,,,,
